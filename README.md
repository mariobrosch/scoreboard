# ttManager

A simple fun project so I can manage our tabletennis games at home between two or four players. Display will show who's turn it is and who the winner is based on the chosen matchtype.

Backend is a simple rest php application which can be used generally or local storage with json files (good enough for such a small project). Over time the php and mySql endpoint is more efficient because of parsing times of the files in JSON. 

Database is of course in my situation a MySql db. A schema can be based on the models.
